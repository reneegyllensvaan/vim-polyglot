A collection of language packs for Vim.

> One to rule them all, one to find them, one to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.

- It **won't affect your startup time**, as scripts are loaded only on demand\*.
- It **installs and updates 120+ times faster** than the <!--Package Count-->79<!--/Package Count--> packages it consists of.
- It is more secure because scripts loaded for all extensions are generated by vim-polyglot (ftdetect).
- Solid syntax and indentation support (other features skipped). Only the best language packs.
- All unnecessary files are ignored (like enormous documentation from php support).
- Automatically detect indentation (includes performance-optimized version of [vim-sleuth](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sleuth))
- Each build is tested by automated vimrunner script on CI. See `spec` directory.

\*To be completely honest, optimized `ftdetect` script takes around `10ms` to load.

## Installation

1. Install [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim), or [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) package manager for Vim.
2. Use this repository as submodule or package.

For example when using [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```
Plug 'sheerun/vim-polyglot'
```

Optionally download one of the [releases](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot/releases) and unpack it directly under `~/.vim` directory.

You can also use Vim 8 built-in package manager:

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-polyglot
```

NOTE: Not all features of individual language packs are available. We strip them from functionality slowing vim startup (for example we ignore `plugins` folder that is loaded regardless of file type, instead we prefer `ftplugin` which is loaded lazily).

If you need full functionality of any plugin, please use it directly with your plugin manager.

## Language packs

<!--/Language Packs-->

## Updating

You can either wait for new patch release with updates or run `make` by yourself.

## Troubleshooting

Please make sure you have `syntax on` in your `.vimrc` (or use something like [sheerun/vimrc](https://github.com/sheerun/vimrc))

Individual language packs can be disabled by setting `g:polyglot_disabled` as follows:

```vim
let g:polyglot_disabled = ['markdown']
```

The list of available languages to disable is shown above.

*Please declare this variable before polyglot is loaded (at the top of .vimrc)*

If you wish to use filetype detection by Vim Polyglot but you'd like to use your own syntax-highlighting plugin, you can append `.plugin` to disabled entry, like below. Disabling Vim Polyglot filetype plugin won't disable native Vim filetype plugin.

```vim
let g:polyglot_disabled = ['markdown.plugin']
```

Please note that disabling a language won't make in your vim startup any faster / slower (only for specific this specific filetype). All plugins are lazily loaded only when they are really needed. 

Vim Polyglot tries to automatically detect indentation settings (just like vim-sleuth). If this feature is not working for you for some reason, please file an issue and disable it temporarily with:

```vim
let g:polyglot_disabled = ['autoindent']
```

## Contributing

Language packs are periodically updated using automated `scripts/build` script.

Feel free to add your language to `packages.yaml` + `heuristics.yaml`, and send pull-request. You can run `make test` to run rough tests. And `make dev` for easy development.
